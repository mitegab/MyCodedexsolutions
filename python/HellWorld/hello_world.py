Hello World
# Print
In Python, the print() function is used to tell a computer to "talk." This is something we are going to use a lot.



The message we want to display should be inside the parentheses and surrounded by quotes. They can be double quotes " or single quotes ', but the opening and closing quote marks have to be the same.

This is an example of a print() function:

print('ðŸ‘‹ Howdy')

In the example above, we instructed our program to print a message. This resulting text that is printed to the screen is referred to as the output.

The output of this example program would be:

ðŸ‘‹ Howdy

Instructions
Create a new hello_world.py program.

On a new line, use print() to output the message "Hello World!"

And then run the program.

Were you able to print "Hello World!" in the terminal

print("Hello World!")
