Fizz Buzz is a children's word game that teaches division. It's also a classic technical interview question at countless companies. 🐝

Though this challenge may appear simple to experienced coders, it is designed to weed out 90% of job candidates who cannot apply their coding knowledge to a new problem creatively. Want to give it a try?

Create a fizz_buzz.py program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

Here's the catch:

    For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
    For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
    Here's the tricky part: For multiples of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

"""

for i in range (100):
    if (i+1) % 3 == 0 and (i+1) % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif (i+1) % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif (i+1) % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i+1)
